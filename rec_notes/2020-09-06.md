# Trello Tasks

From the other day, I compiled the following coding tasks.

- Recipe cleaner: Takes the recipes as input and output a cleaned set of recipes
- Recipe vectorizer: Takes the cleaned recipes as input and outputs a vector representation
    - This can first take form of a tfid thingy....this is what I shall start with
    - Or I could also use a word embedding algorithm to generate the vector representation.
- Proximity model: Takes as input a vectorized recipe and finds the nearest or most similar set of recipes

In order to add this all to trello, I will want to have a title and then some brief description with a possible checklist.

- [ ] **Recipe cleaner**
    - _Takes the recipes as input and outputs a cleaned/formated set of recipes_
    - Input: Recipes
    - Process: Clean and format for future analyses
    - Output: Table of recipes
    - Future Items: Have this be saved in a database
- [ ] **Recipe vectorizer with TFIDF**
    - _Takes the cleaned recipes as inputs and outputs a vector representation based on TFIDF_
    - Input: Recipes
    - Process: Use TFIDF to generate a vector representation of each recipe
    - Output: Matrix with recipes in the rows and columns with the vector representation
- [ ] **Proximity Model**
    - _Take a vectorized recipe and find the most similar set of X recipes_
    - Input: A vectorized recipe
    - Process: Use k-nearest neighbor approach to find recipes most similar to input
    - Output: List of most similar recipes in ranked order


# Recipe Cleaner

We can load up the recipe data now in python
