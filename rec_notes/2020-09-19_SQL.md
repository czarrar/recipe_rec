This contains notes from what I've learned so far by using SQL.

## Where vs Having

Here's an example of both in action.

```
SELECT  user_id, (AVG(rating*rating) - AVG(rating)*AVG(rating)) AS var_rating, COUNT(*) AS n_ratings
FROM  interactions  
    WHERE  dateLastModified >= strftime('%s','2013-01-01')  
GROUP  BY  user_id  
HAVING var_rating > 0  AND n_ratings > 2;
```

Notice that

* WHERE is done on the whole table before the aggregate AVG function is calculated
* HAVING is done after doing the aggregate function

## Variance

We can do some clever data munging and calculate the variance on the fly with the following query sub-string.

```
(AVG(col*col) - AVG(col)*AVG(col)) AS var_rating
```

## Temporary Table

You can have a table that lasts for the duration of the session. I found this easier to split up some complicated query in a way that I might understand.

```
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE [name] AS
[SELECT QUERY]
```

## Date

I have used an integer date function and here I will take from a dateLastModified column, which has the date stored to the second.


* INT => STR
    * If I want to extract the date-time (YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) from an integer, here's what I do: `datetime(dateLastModified, 'unixepoch')`
    * Say if I want a subset of that date-time like the year:`strftime('%Y', dateLastModified, 'unixepoch')`
* STR => INT 
    * `strftime('%s','2013-01-01')`
    * `strftime('%s','2013-01-01 00:00:00')` # Same thing

## Subquery

Sometimes we need to have a select query within another select query. In the example below this is because you can't have the `max` in the WHERE clause (it has to be part of the select).

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, quiz_points  
FROM people  
WHERE quiz_points = (SELECT MAX(quiz_points) FROM people);
```

## String Operations

There are a bunch of operations that you can have occur on strings.

* LOWER or UPPER
* SUBSTR(col, start, end) where start can even be a negative number
* REPLACE(col, find, replace)

## Bug? or What?

I've been batting my brains at this particular error. I'm still not clear why this doesn't work at all. It is frustrating.

```
SELECT  user_id, recipe_id, rating, dateLastModified, datetime(dateLastModified, 'unixepoch') AS d,   
	(CASE  WHEN  dateLastModified < strftime('%s','2013-01-01 00:00:00') THEN  1  ELSE  0  END) AS training1,   
	(CASE  WHEN (strftime('%Y', dateLastModified, 'unixepoch') < 2013) THEN  1  ELSE  0  END) AS training2,  
	(CASE  WHEN (dateLastModified - strftime('%s','2013-01-01')) < 0  THEN  1  ELSE  0  END) AS training3,  
	(CASE  WHEN (strftime('%Y', dateLastModified, 'unixepoch') - 2013) < 0  THEN  1  ELSE  0  END) AS training4,  
	(strftime('%Y', dateLastModified, 'unixepoch') - 2013) AS training5
FROM  interactions  
ORDER  BY  user_id, d ASC  
LIMIT  100;
```

So I can see from this that training3 and training4 columns work. For some reason the date comparison in training1 didn't work. I'm not totally sure why since strftime should convert into an integer and a comparison should work. I'll do the training3 one since it converts the string to an int and then do the comparison.
